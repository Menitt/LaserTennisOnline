# LaserTennisOnline
 My first project with online multiplayer.

_Laser Tennis_ is a simple 2 players-game developed using Unreal Engine 5.
 
The game has 3 different game modes:
- Single player: Local player and AI controlled player,
- Local multiplayer: 2 local players,
- Online multiplayer: 1 local player hosting the game (Server) and 1 remote player (Client).

The online game mode utilizes the _Steam Multipayer Subsystem_ to establish a connection between Client and Server. 
This mode fully supports network replication within the Server-Client framework of Unreal Engine.
